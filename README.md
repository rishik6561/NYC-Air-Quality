Predicting NYC Air Quality with MICE, Bootstrapping, and Elastic Net Regression

Overview
Welcome to my project on Predicting NYC Air Quality using advanced statistical techniques. In this project, I have leveraged multiple methodologies including Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), Bootstrapping, and Elastic Net Regression to develop a robust predictive model for air quality in New York City.

Key Features
Data Import and EDA: The NYC air quality dataset was imported and subjected to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable trends and observations.
Model Building: A linear regression model was constructed by splitting the data into training and testing sets to predict air quality.
Missing Data Analysis: A Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) Test was conducted to identify any relationships among the missing values.
Multiple Imputation: Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) using the Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) method was employed to generate multiple imputed datasets. Separate linear regression models were built for each imputed dataset to compare performance.
Bootstrapping and Elastic Net Regression: Bootstrapping and Elastic Net Regression with cross-validation were implemented to create a more robust predictive model, taking into account the correlation between variables.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates my proficiency in advanced statistical techniques and my ability to apply them to real-world datasets. By leveraging methodologies such as MICE, Bootstrapping, and Elastic Net Regression, I have developed a robust predictive model for NYC air quality. The insights derived from this analysis can be valuable for policymakers and environmental agencies in managing air quality in urban areas.
